\section{Evaluating the System}

Literature shows us the importance of designing for health and presents us with three questions for evaluating these technologies for behaviour change \cite{article_designing_for_health_behaviour_change_hci}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is it usable?
\item Does it meet their needs?
\item Is it effective?
\end{enumerate}
These questions are drawn from several fields of study, not just HCI research, considering long-term effects and efficiency. These will be the chatbot evaluation basis.

\subsection{User studies}
The above three questions will be used as the starting point for surveys to ask users for feedback on the implementation.

\subsection{Testing automaticity}
To measure if the chatbot completed the hypothesis, users habit automaticity will be tested after the study and during the 1 week follow up study.
