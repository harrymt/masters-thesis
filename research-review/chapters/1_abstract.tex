\section*{Executive Summary}

Habits are automatic actions that require little effort. For example automatically washing your hand after using the toilet is a habit. Forming new positive habits has many benefits, in health and other areas. Forming a new habit requires three elements. Repetition, contextual cues and positive reinforcement. On average, habits take 66 days of repetitive use to become automatic.\newline
\newline
Mobile technology can help form habits using these three elements, by reminding use to repeat the habit, giving us contextual cues and rewarding us to form positive reinforcement. However most existing systems are not grounded in theory and build repetitive actions rather than habit automaticity. People become dependent on the technology rather than the habit. This is bad because when we remove the system, the habit performance decreases. Therefore, successful habit forming systems should build habit automaticity.\newline
\newline
The current state of habit-forming mobile systems use apps for interaction, encouraging the user to repeat actions using the app. This creates a dependency between the app and the user. Users are dependant on the app to repeat the habit. When the app is removed, the user stops repeating the habit. This dependancy decreases habit automaticity.\newline
\newline
This project aims to explore a different implementation that supports habit-formation, by using a chatbot.\newline
Chatbots are a method of communicating with a computer system using natural language. They provide deeper integration into users mobile phone, as they hook into messaging services users are familiar with. When users stop using chatbots the impact is less than removing an app, as the user simply stops having a conversation with the chatbot.\newline
\newline
The literature presents us with a set of design requirements for habit forming apps that build habit automaticity, focused on routine-based remembering strategies. Combined with another study, showing that good reminder and remembering systems should also interact with the user across different modalities, to allow delivery of triggers and rewards across a modality to suit different types of users. This project will base the design of the chatbot on these requirements and principles to deliver habit rewards across multiple modalities.\newline
\newline
This project aims to build a chatbot that supports habit formation, by building habit automaticity with multi-modal interaction over 30 days. After removing the chatbot, users should continue to perform the habit. The chatbot will provide habit tracking by means of reminders as a trigger, and rewards in three modalities, visual, auditory and tactile. A 30 day user study, and a 1 week follow up study will test the success of the chatbot by evaluating effectiveness of each modality on habit automaticity. Chatbot interaction will be removed during the follow up study to test if users continue with the habit. Three groups, and a control group, will each receive reminders and rewards from a different modality.\newline
\newline
The project will deliver a chatbot that supports habit formation, design recommendations for building chatbots that support habit formation and analysis of the effectiveness of different modalities on habit automaticity.
