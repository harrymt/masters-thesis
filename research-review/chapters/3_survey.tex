\section{Habit Formation}

  \subsection*{What is a habit}



  - What does it mean to form a habit
    - Examples
  \subsection{Benifits}
    - How can we benefit from knowing how to form this?
    - How does CS benefit
      - Health benefits
      - Problems with forgetting thing @TODO kathy
  \subsection{Theory}
    - General theory for forming habits
    - Time to form, 66 days, @lally
  \subsubsection{Trigger}
      - What is this
      - Kathys research
  \subsubsection{Action}
      - List of habits
      - Types of habits that are effective
        - Using this?
  \subsubsection{Reward}
      - General info
      - Types
    - When users stop doing this automaticity is reduced
  \subsubsection{Automaticity}
      - What is it
      - Why is it needed
    - Big up needing technology for this process, 'if only we could do this automatically'

\newpage

  \subsection{Technology}
    - How can we use tech for this problem


  \subsubsection{State}
      - Current apps available
      - Kathys Research

  \subsubsection{Problems}
      \subsubsection{- Not grounded in science}
        - Kathys research, state
      \subsubsection{- Lack of automaticity}
        - Doesn't develop when you remove the system
      \subsubsection{- Dependant on tech}
        - To do with lack of automaticity
        - However, chatbots are not dependant on tech, as everyone will have a messaging platform, e.g. fb messenger

  \subsubsection{Existing Research}
      - Trigger, Action, [Reward]
      \subsubsection{- Kathys Research}
        - Design requirements
      \subsubsection{- Taxonomy of...}
        - Reward focused


\newpage

  \subsubsection{Requirements for Habit Reward system}
      - List of combined requirements
      - However still lack of retention, but, there is hope,
      <
        table of requirements
        - Foucs on just rewards
        - I will use kathys reqs for tracking requirements
      >
      - @TODO multimodal research says using multiple modalities improves retention / automaticity

\newpage

\section{Multi-Modal}
  - What is a Modalitiy
  - Research into how multiple modalities improve retention
  - Different types, most common and @TODO research says these are most effective
  \subsection{Types}
  \subsubsection{Audio}
      - What is it
      - Why are we choosing it
      - Examples
      \subsubsection{- Why is it good?}
        - What does it give to us
        - @TODO research
      \subsubsection{- Reward}
        - Cross check with my requirements
  \subsubsection{Visual}
      - What is it
      - Why are we choosing it
      - Examples
      \subsubsection{- Why is it good?}
        - @TODO research
      \subsubsection{- Reward}
        - Cross check with my requirements
  \subsubsection{Vibration}
      - What is it
      - Why are we chosing it
      - Examples
      - Wearables, Fitbit
    \subsubsection{Why is it good?}
        - @TODO research
    \subsubsection{Reward}
        - Cross check with requirements

\newpage
  \subsection{Table of multimodal reward implementation strategies}
    - Table of requirements matched with modalities
    - If you could implement this, you could increase users automaticity for habits

\newpage
\section{Building the System}
  \subsection{Design Implications}
    - Setup:
      - Setup the bot via a messaging platform, such as fb messenger
    - Trigger:
        - Either A, certain configured time of the day
        -        B: No trigger
        -        C: Around a specific time
    - Action:
      - Choose habit from list of habits
      - Perform
      - Use app to track the action
    - Reward:
      - You get one of these rewards, based on modalitiy selected
      - Vision
        - Through message, of an image or gif
        - Could be: App, or message, gif
      - Audatory
        - Through phone via bot, link to mp3/spotify/apple music
        - Could be: App
      - Tactic
        - Through wearable
        - Could be: App, bot triggers wearbale alarm



  \subsubsection{Example user flow}
      - Pre-Start
        - Choose daily habit type from list of X, e.g. 1 press up before breakfast
        - Enable notifications or fitbit if chosen
        - Time action / reward, variable rewards, e.g. then work out average time to send, or none
      - Start:
        - New day
        - @ trigger time, send reminder, if set, notification
        - Open notification, do habit, press tracked
        - Get reward type

\newpage
  \subsection{Implementation}
    - Web app could be chosen because its easiest and achievable, however the ease of use with a chatbot, integrated into fb messenger means everyone can use it on multiple devices. The addition, means that people get used to the UI.
  \subsubsection{Technology}
      - 3 Types:
        1. specific apps
          - Bad cuz takes a long time
        2. Web Apps
          - Still another app
        3. Chatbot
          - Good useful
      - Android/iOS/chatbot specific notifications from web app
      - Save to home screen
  \subsubsection{Reward Modality implementations}
      - Vision
        - Send notification
        - Show nice visuals
      - Audio
        - Send notification
        - Play uplifting music
      - Tactic
        - A.P.I. sets wearable alarm
        - Wearable (fitbit) issues and tracks alarm times
    \subsection{Component overview}
      [app] -------> (Database) -----> at certain time ---> Send notification to trigger type of reward
      [ big button that says track]

\section{Implementation old}

Habit formation, Don't Kick the Habit \cite{article_dont_kick_habit}, stopping the behaviour when one stops using behaviour change apps.
Measuring Habit strength \cite{article_habit_strength} \cite{article_habit_measurement}.

Multi-Modal interaction, using multiple modalities for habit formation \cite{}, using wearable devices, such as a Fitbit device is plausible for a study \cite{article_wearable_good}.

Gamification elements \cite{f2p_games_how_to}, can we use any elements from Free-To-Play games?
