\section{Habit Formation}
  - What is a habit\newline
  - What does it mean to form a habit\newline
    - Examples\newline
  \subsection{Benifits}
    - How can we benefit from knowing how to form this?\newline
    - How does CS benefit\newline
      - Health benefits\newline
      - Problems with forgetting thing @TODO kathy
  \subsection{Theory}
    - General theory for forming habits\newline
    - Time to form, 66 days, @lally
  \subsubsection{Trigger}
      - What is this\newline
      - Kathys research
  \subsubsection{Action}
      - List of habits\newline
      - Types of habits that are effective\newline
        - Using this?
  \subsubsection{Reward}
      - General info\newline
      - Types\newline
    - When users stop doing this automaticity is reduced
  \subsubsection{Automaticity}
      - What is it\newline
      - Why is it needed\newline
    - Big up needing technology for this process, 'if only we could do this automatically'
  \subsection{Technology}
    - How can we use tech for this problem
  \subsubsection{State}
      - Current apps available\newline
      - Kathys Research
  \subsubsection{Problems}
      \subsubsection{- Not grounded in science}
        - Kathys research, state
      \subsubsection{- Lack of automaticity}
        - Doesnt develop when you remove the system
      \subsubsection{- Dependant on tech}
        - To do with lack of automaticity
  \subsubsection{Existing Research}
      - Trigger, Action, [Reward]
      \subsubsection{- Kathys Resaerch}
        - Design requirements
      \subsubsection{- Taxonomy of...}
        - Reward focused
  \subsubsection{Requirements for Habit Reward system}
      - List of combined requirments\newline
      - However still lack of retention, but, there is hope,\newline
      <\newline
        table of requirements\newline
        - Foucs on just rewards\newline
        - I will use kathys reqs for tracking requirements\newline
      >\newline
      - @TODO multimodal research says using multiplemodalieis improves retention / automaticity

\section{Multi-Modal}
  - What is a Modalitiy\newline
  - Research into how multiple modalities improve retention\newline
  - Different types, most common and @TODO research says these are most effective
  \subsection{Types}
  \subsubsection{Audio}
      - What is it\newline
      - Why are we choosing it\newline
      - Examples
      \subsubsection{- Why is it good?}
        - What does it give to us\newline
        - @TODO research
      \subsubsection{- Reward}
        - Cross check with my requirements
  \subsubsection{Visual}
      - What is it\newline
      - Why are we choosing it\newline
      - Examples
      \subsubsection{- Why is it good?}
        - @TODO research
      \subsubsection{- Reward}
        - Cross check with my requirments
  \subsubsection{Vibration}
      - What is it\newline
      - Why are we chosing it\newline
      - Examples\newline
      - Wearables, Fitbit
    \subsubsection{Why is it good?}
        - @TODO research
    \subsubsection{Reward}
        - Cross check with requirements
  \subsection{Table of multimodal reward implementation strategies}
    - Table of requirements matched with modalities\newline
    - If you could implement this, you could increase users automaticity for habits

\section{Building the System}
  \subsection{Design Implications}
    - Trigger:\newline
        - Either A, certain configured time of the day\newline
        -        B: No trigger\newline
        -        C: Around a specific time\newline
    - Action:\newline
      - Choose habit from list of habits\newline
      - Perform\newline
      - Use app to track the action\newline
    - Reward:\newline
      - You get one of these rewards, based on modalitiy selected\newline
      - Vision\newline
        - Through Web app\newline
        - Could be: App, or message\newline
      - Audatory\newline
        - Through phone\newline
        - Could be: App\newline
      - Tactic\newline
        - Through wearable\newline
        - Could be: App
  \subsubsection{Example user flow}
      - Pre-Start\newline
        - Choose daily habit type from list of X, e.g. 1 press up before breakfast\newline
        - Enable notifications or fitbit if chosen\newline
        - Time action / reward, variable rewards, e.g. then work out average time to send, or none\newline
      - Start:\newline
        - New day\newline
        - @ trigger time, send reminder, if set, notification\newline
        - Open notification, do habit, press tracked\newline
        - Get reward type
  \subsection{Implementation}
    - Web app chosen because easiest and achievable
  \subsubsection{Technology}
      - React JS\newline
      - Android/iOS specific notifications from web app\newline
      - Save to home screen
  \subsubsection{Reward Modality implementations}
      - Vision\newline
        - Send notification\newline
        - Show nice visuals\newline
      - Audio\newline
        - Send notification\newline
        - Play uplifting music\newline
      - Tactic\newline
        - A.P.I. sets wearable alarm\newline
        - Wearable (fitbit) issues and tracks alarm times
    \subsection{Component overview}
      [app] -------> (Database) -----> at certain time ---> Send notification to trigger type of reward\newline
      [ big button that says track]\newline

\section{Implementation old}

Habit formation, Don't Kick the Habit \cite{article_dont_kick_habit}, stopping the behaviour when one stops using behaviour change apps.\newline
Measuring Habit strength \cite{article_habit_strength} \cite{article_habit_measurement}.\newline
\newline
Multi-Modal interaction, using multiple modalities for habit formation \cite{}, using wearable devices, such as a Fitbit device is plausible for a study \cite{article_wearable_good}.\newline
\newline
Gamification elements \cite{f2p_games_how_to}, can we use any elements from Free-To-Play games?\newline
\newline
