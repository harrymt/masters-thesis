\section{Work Plan}

For this project there are X number of milestones to achieve.


\subsection*{Scope}
% Scope	and	is	the	relevance	of	the	reviewed	work	to	the	 project	is	always	made	clear?

\subsection*{Expected Timeline}

The app is to be built, then two 30 day user studies will test the effectiveness of the app techniques.


% \begin{verbatim}
% % App: building | testing  | evaluating |            |
% % System B:          | building | testing    | evaluating |
% % System C:          |          | building   | testing    | evaluating
% \end{verbatim}


@TODO find a way to add a title, and 'week' label
@TODO only have 1 user study, but have 1 added week as a follow up study with no system interaction
