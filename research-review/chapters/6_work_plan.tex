\section{Work Plan}
For this project there are four milestones that split into two parts, Building and Testing.


\subsection{Milestones}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Building
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 1.1 Build the Chatbot.
    \item 1.2 Build delivery of rewards from 3 modalities, Visual, Auditory and Tactile.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Testing
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 2.1 Conduct 30 User Study.
    \item 2.2 Conduct 7 day Follow up study.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tasks}

\subsubsection*{1. Building}
Tasks for building the chatbot are to implement:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Interaction between a user and our system via the Facebook Messenger platform.
  \item Question-response statements for the chatbot.
  \item Training the chatbot on these responses.
  \item Reminder component for habit triggers.
  \item Visual rewards.
  \item Auditory rewards.
  \item Tactile virbation rewards by integrating with FitBit.
  \item On-boarding for new users to get started with the chatbot.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{2. Testing}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Test the chatbot using a unit-test harness, to increase the quality of the chatbot.
 \item Write 30 day user study.
 \item Write 7 day follow up study.
 \item Conduct 30 day user study, users will use the chatbot daily to track a habit and perform a habit automaticity test before the study starts and after it has finished.
 \item Conduct 7 day follow up study, users will stop using the chatbot, after 7 days will be contacted to perform a habit automaticity test and present how often they performed their habit in the 7 days.
 \item Analyse study results.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Risk Analysis}
Problems that might occur in the project are summarised below with contingency plans and risk mitigation techniques.

\begin{tabular}{ |p{1.5cm}|p{1.9cm}|p{2.3cm}|p{3.3cm}|p{5cm}| }
  \hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Main Project Risks} \\ \hline % Title
  \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Likelihood} & \textbf{Risk} & \textbf{Prevention} & \textbf{Contingency} \\ \hline % Row
  5 & 1 & Chatbot could break during user study. & A unit-test harness will be constructed to increase the quality of the prototype before the user study. & Design recommendations can still be used from chatbot construction and if the chatbot doesn't completely break, the modalities that work can be tested against users. \\ \hline
  4 & 4 & Low sample size of users with wearable devices. & A popular wearable device has been chosen for integration to increase the number of users. & Additional wearable device integrations will be added, such as Jawbone, to increase pool of users. \\ \hline
  4 & 2 & Low sample size for user study. & Participants will be recruited ahead of time and University resources will be utilised. & Qualitative feedback will be gathered and focused upon, rather than quantitative to gleam a better understanding of design recommendations.\\ \hline
  3 & 2 & Under-estimate task length. & Overestimation of project tasks allows for task slippage. & Modification of project objectives allows for a focus on HCI design recommendations for building chatbots that support habit formation. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Deliverables}
To summarise, these are the following key project deliverables.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Chatbot that supports habit formation.
  \item Analysis about how rewards from different modalities affect habit automaticity.
  \item Design recommendations for building a habit formation chatbot.
\end{itemize}
