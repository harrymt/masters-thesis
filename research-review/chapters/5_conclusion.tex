\section{Conclusion}

\subsection*{Will this be a successful project?}
The design of the chatbot is heavily influenced by requirements grounded on habit-formation theory.
This gives us a strong standing on the success of the implementation, as long as it adheres to those requirements.

\subsection*{Can we obtain the value that this project adds?}
If users do not increasing habit-automaticity, the project still presents a novel method of interacting with users to track habits.
Evaluation of this system still provides value on how to build chatbots to support habit formaiton.
