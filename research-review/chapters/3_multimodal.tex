\section{Multi-Modal}
  - What is a Modalitiy
  - Research into how multiple modalities improve retention
  - Different types, most common and @TODO research says these are most effective
  \subsection{Methods of Interaction}
  \subsubsection*{Audio}
      - What is it
      - Why are we choosing it
      - Examples
      \subsubsection*{- Why is it good?}
        - What does it give to us
        - @TODO research
      \subsubsection*{- Reward}
        - Cross check with my requirements
  \subsubsection*{Visual}
      - What is it
      - Why are we choosing it
      - Examples
      \subsubsection*{- Why is it good?}
        - @TODO research
      \subsubsection*{- Reward}
        - Cross check with my requirements
  \subsubsection*{Tactile}
      - What is it
      - Why are we chosing it

      - Wearables, Fitbit
    \subsubsection*{Why is it good?}
        - @TODO research
    \subsubsection*{Reward}
        - Cross check with requirements

  \subsection{Delivering Rewards}
    - Table of multimodal reward implementation strategies
    - Table of requirements matched with modalities
    - If you could implement this, you could increase users automaticity for habits
