\section{Evaluation}
Below we present our evaluation process, that place the prototype in the hands of real people, as recommended by vaildated guidelines \cite{article_mhealth, article_evaluate_tech_health_behaviour_change}.

Many people agree about the importance of designing systems for health and behaviour
change~\cite{article_mhealth, article_designing_for_healthy_lifestyles, article_designing_for_health_behaviour_change_hci}.
But each have varying opinions about how to evaluate these systems. Klasnja et al.~\cite{article_evaluate_tech_health_behaviour_change} focuses on system usability and does it meet the needs of users.
Whereas, Stawarz and Cox~\cite{article_designing_for_health_behaviour_change_hci} argue evaluating a system of this type requires information from other fields
to properly consider the systems effectiveness. The validated Behaviour Change Wheel Framework~\cite{article_behaviour_change_wheel} does just this.
Evaluating the system with validated behaviour change techniques from multiple domains. This project will use this framework to evaluate the chatbot with evaluation trials.
These will test the long-term effect and efficiency of the bot, with information from two fields of study, HCI and health psychology.

Evaluation trials are the final part of the Behaviour Change Wheel Framework~\cite{article_behaviour_change_wheel}.
HCI research that focuses on health interventions~\cite{article_mhealth}, demonstrates the importance of evaluation trials for evaluating mobile health systems.
These trials have three goals to test: objective-quantitative efficacy, subjective-qualitative feedback measures and real-world feedback about how the system is
utilised~\cite{article_evaluate_tech_health_behaviour_change}. I will conduct an evaluation trial for this project.\newline
\newline
The length of the trial will be based on two factors, the time needed to form a habit~\cite{article_how_habits_formed_modelling_habit_formation} and the results of a previous
habit formation trial~\cite{article_beyond_self_tracking_designing_apps}.
First, the number of repetitive days required for an action to be considered a habit varies based on the complexity of the action~\cite{article_how_habits_formed_modelling_habit_formation}.
Simple actions, such as drinking 2 glasses of water a day, can take a minimum of 18 days to form.
The suggested actions used for this project will be considered as simple, e.g. stretching for 30 seconds.
Second, a previous evaluation trial on habit-formation systems~\cite{article_how_habits_formed_modelling_habit_formation} showed an increase in habit automaticity after 4 weeks.
This project will mirror that timeframe.\newline
\newline
A 4-week evaluation trial will test the success of the chatbot by evaluating the tool and the effectiveness of each modality on users habit strength.
Cue reminders from the chatbot will be disabled at week 3 (REQ 4) to test if users continue with the habit.
Participants will split into four groups, all groups will receive reminders, three groups will receive rewards each from a different modality,
and one group (control group) will not recieve any rewards.

Habit strength will be measured using a validated 12-question questionnaire that specifically looks at automaticity~\cite{article_habit_strength}.
Automaticity will also be measured using a validated subset of the questionnaire from~\cite{article_habit_strength} to test users habit behavioural
automaticity index~\cite{article_4q_SRBAI}. This will show the impact each modality has on habit automaticity and test the hypothesis.
Participants will fill out the questionnaires~\cite{article_habit_strength, article_4q_SRBAI} at three stages: half-way through the trial (at 2-weeks),
after the trial has finished and after the follow up trial.

\subsection{Study: Comparing Different Rewards} \label{study_comparing_rewards}
To explore the influence of different modalities on habit formation, a situated study was conducted, followed by semi-structured interviews. For the purpose of the study a chatbot was developed to help users form healthy habits by providing different types of positive reinforcement. The study and the bot itself are described below.


\subsubsection{Hypotheses} \label{hypothese}
To see what the effect positive reinforcement rewards from modalities have on habit formation (RQ1) and how effective chatbots are at supporting habit formation (RQ3) two hypotheses are presented.

\subsubsection*{Hypothesis 1: positive reinforcement is effective at supporting habit formation by increasing automaticity and regular habit performance.}
Rewards from the following modalities will be tested: visual, auditory and visual-auditory. They will be delivered using a prototype chatbot to different groups of participants. They will be compared against two measurements: habit automaticity and habit performance. Previous studies~\cite{article_habit_strength, article_4q_SRBAI} demonstrate the strength of a habit is based on how automatic the action is. In addition, how regular the habit is performed in another good indicator of habit strength~\cite{article_promoting_habit_formation, article_experiences_of_habit_formation}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{H1M1: The effect of positive reinforcement rewards on habit performance}
  \item \textit{H1M2: The effect of positive reinforcement rewards on habit automaticity}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Hypothesis 2: multiple modalities rewards are more effective then singular mode rewards.}
Multiple modalities combined has been shown to improve task performance in some studies. This hypothesis will test how this affects habit performance and habit automaticity.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{H2M1: The effect of multiple modalities versus singular on habit performance}
  \item \textit{H2M2: The effect of multiple modalities versus singular on habit automaticity}
\end{itemize}

The measurements are habit performance (measurement 1, M1), calculated by the number of habits a participant marked as completed, incremented when a participant presses '\textit{completed habit}' on the bot and habit automaticity (measurement 2, M2), calculated from two Self-Report Behavioural Automaticity Index~\cite{article_4q_SRBAI} questionnaires. In addition to these two hypotheses, the success of the prototype will also be evaluated with user interviews to understand what people's attitudes are towards the chatbot (RQ2) and how effective they are for supporting habit formation (RQ3).

  \caption{The landing page (\url{www.harrymt.com/harryshabits}) participants would see before they are taken to the Messenger bot.}
  \label{fig:landing_page}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Method}
The study aims to test the hypotheses comparing how well people form new habits based on the rewards and how the bot-delivered rewards effect participants habit formation.


The 4-week evaluation trial was split into two sections. First a 3-week trial tested the success of the chatbot by evaluating the tool and the effectiveness of each modality on participants habit automaticity using a validated questionnaire~\cite{article_4q_SRBAI}. During the fourth week, chatbot interaction was removed during a 1-week follow up trial to test if participants continue with the habit. Participants were split into four groups (Table~\ref{table:precise_rewards}), all groups receiving reminders, three groups receiving rewards each from a different modality, and one group (control group) did not receive any rewards.


\subsubsection{Participants}
60 participants were recruited with public posts to social networks (Appendix~\ref{app:recruitment}) and were mostly University students and staff. The process participants undertook is documented by the recruitment adverts (Appendix~\ref{app:recruitment}), the landing page (Figure~\ref{fig:landing_page}) and the setup screens (Section~\ref{user_flow}). They were instructed to connect with the bot via Facebook Messenger and pick a series of options to set-up their habit tracking. Participants answered general demographic information as set up questions from the bot when they connected with it (Section~\ref{user_flow}), this was seen as their consent to participate in the study.

\begin{itemize}
  \item ``What is your gender?''
    \item ``How old are you?''
    \item ``Have you used habit tracking systems before? If did they work and what were they?''
    \item ``What habit do you want to track?''
    \item ``What existing routine would you like to use?''
    \item ``What time does that routine occur?''
    \item ``Would you like to be interviewed about your experience after the study?''
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Study Design}
Participants were instructed to connect with the bot via Facebook Messenger and pick a series of options to set-up their habit tracking. A brief description accompanied these options, to guide the participants on how to answer. The habits participants could choose were split into two categories, physical and relaxation. They were: stretching, press ups, the plank, reading, writing or meditation. Participants were aware of these habits before they consented to the study and if they did not want to form any of these habits they would not start the study. These simple actions were chosen to match the length of the study, as simple tasks become automatic quicker than complex actions~\cite{article_how_habits_formed_modelling_habit_formation}, for example a drinking water habit only takes, on average, 18 days of repetitive use.

The study used four conditions (Table~\ref{table:precise_rewards}): visual rewards, auditory rewards, visual-auditory rewards and a control without a reward. Participants were randomly assigned a condition by the bot after they completed the set-up, 15 participants were assigned to each condition. The rewards were aimed at motivating participants to keep coming back every day and completing their habits. Each GIF and audio track were selected based on popular combinations of videos and soundtracks (Figure~\ref{fig:visual_audio_combined_rewards}). A search for ``motivation'' on the website \url{https://www.reddit.com/r/GifSound/} to find suitable pairings of video and audio. The video was converted into a GIF with the speed adjusted to match the speed of the audio. The relationship between the audio and the visual is inferred, therefore this mapping is \textit{semi-congruent}. 5 GIFs and 5 matching audio tracks were selected as the rewards. Visual rewards had only the GIFs, auditory had only the audio and visual-auditory had them both at the same time. They can be found in the GitHub repo of the chatbot \url{https://github.com/harrymt/harryshabits/tree/master/public}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{visual rewards}: participants would receive a message that when tapped, would reveal a GIF aimed at motivating them.
\item \textit{auditory rewards}: participants would receive a message that when tapped, would play a song aimed at motivating them.
\item \textit{visual-auditory rewards}: participants would receive a message that when tapped, would play a song and reveal a GIF, aimed at motivating them.
\item \textit{no rewards (control group)}: participants would only receive a confirmation message.
\end{itemize}

Participants would receive a confirmation message, followed by a positive reinforcement reward after they marked a habit as complete, unless they were in the control group, then they would only receive a confirmation message. Information about how well a participant was performing was not revealed, to separate the rewards from other types of motivation, as streaks can provide motivation~\cite{article_dont_kick_habit}.

  \label{fig:srbai_questionnaire}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Materials}
The bot collected the amount of habits participants completed (M1) versus their reward type. Habit automaticity (M2) was verified by using the Self-Report Behavioural Automaticity Index (SRBAI)~\cite{article_4q_SRBAI} (Figure~\ref{fig:srbai_questionnaire}) --- A validated set of questions to measure habit automaticity levels. This was used to test if participants were forming a habit. Additional questions were also asked about how participants found their rewards and how they found interacting with the chatbot. Finally, interviews with participants were conducted for further verification to discuss how they found the bot-delivered rewards.

\subsubsection{Procedure}
First, an internal pilot trial with 3 participants was conducted to develop the strength of the prototype. Minor language changes were made as a result of this, to better explain how participants should proceed. Second, a  4-week situated study was conducted with real people who wanted to try and form a new positive habit. The length of the study was appropriate for the simplicity of each habit and was based on the lengths of a previous habit formation study~\cite{article_beyond_self_tracking_designing_apps}. Finally, follow-up interviews with participants revealed if participants continued with their habit without the bot.

At the beginning of the 3-week period, participants gave their consent to take part in the study as required by the ethics committee (reference id: 54701) and were asked to answer basic demographic information and choose a new habit they would like to develop from a list of habits of similar difficulty, divided into two categories: physical and relaxation. Then they were asked to state an existing routine they could build their new habit around, and choose a time that routine normally occurred (morning, afternoon, evening). After they had answered these questions, they would be randomly assigned a modality (unknown to users) for rewards. Participants would complete their chosen habit every day after their existing routine, then wait for the bot to send them a message asking them for one of two choices.

Option one (completed habit): participants would receive a message thanking them, then participants not in the control group would receive a message linking them to a reward. This reward would be from the modality auto-assigned to that participant during the set-up phase (Table~\ref{table:precise_rewards}). Option two (not yet): the bot would check on the participant an hour later. This allowed for the checks to be snoozed, to ensure the new habit fit in with participants routine. If participants constantly told the bot they had not completed their habit yet, the bot would ask participants if they would like to change the time their routine occurred (Figure~\ref{fig:snoozing_too_much}). This allowed the participants in the beginning to refine the time they would perform their habit.


\begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[width=2in]{resources/design/media/4.png}
  \caption{Participants would receive a message asking them if they would like to change their backup notification time.}
  \label{fig:snoozing_too_much}
\end{figure}

After 3 weeks of participants interacting with the bot, all participants who completed the set up were asked to complete the SRBAI questionnaire. Then the bot interaction was suspended for 1 week. After the full 4-week period, participants were asked to complete the questionnaire again. The SRBAI presents the questions on a 5-point Likert scale with answers from 'Strongly Disagree' (5) to 'Strongly Agree' (1). Higher scores indicates higher self-reported levels of automaticity. In addition, participants had an option to opt-in for an interview about their experience after the 4-week period.

\subsection{Results}
60 participants connected with the bot by pressing \textit{'Get Started'} in Facebook Messenger on the following platforms: 25 participants used a web browser, 18 used iOS and 12 used Android. 14 participants, or 23\% dropped out of the study at various stages (Figure~\ref{fig:study_dropout}): 54 participants, or 90\% continued interacting with the bot and started the set-up. 39 participants, or 65\% completed the set-up and out of these 39 participants, 3 participants ignored all messages from the bot during the trial. Leaving 36 participants, or 66\% that are considered active throughout and are included in the final analysis.


The 36 participants who completed the study are 18-63 years old, (mean: 27 years old, SD: 12), 23 or, 64\% male, 11 or, 30\% female and 2 or, 6\% didn't say. These 36 remaining participants are split into the following modalities: 14 participants or, 93\% visual, 9 participants or, 60\% visual-auditory, 7 participants or, 46\% auditory and 6 participants or, 40\% had no rewards (control group). 36 participants sent a total of 1.1k messages to the bot (mean = 65 messages per participant) and the bot sent 2.7k total messages back. 184 total habits were marked as completed, with the bot issuing 69 visual rewards, 58 visual-auditory rewards and 17 auditory rewards to those participants. The control group completed 40 habits.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Habit Performance}
Comparing the number of participants who dropped out of the study versus their reward modality, shows that 7 participants who dropped out of the study had 27 visual rewards in total (mean = 3.85). 2 participants had 4 total auditory rewards (mean = 2) and 2 participants had 2 visual-auditory combined (mean = 6.5). These visual-auditory participants that dropped out had the highest amount of snoozes (24 total snoozes, 6 and 18 individually, mean = 12), compared with visual 10 total (mean = 2), and auditory with 0 snoozes.

7 participants, or 19\% previously used habit tracking systems and 36 participants, or 100\% stated they worked well for tracking habits. These habits were: 'Diet' (3 mentions), 'Exercise' (3 mentions), 'Deadlines' (2 mentions), 'Audiobook reading' (1 mention), 'Weight' (1 mention). All of these participants chose new habits that they had not tracked before. Meditation was the most popular habit chosen 12 participants, or 33\%, followed by Press ups 8 participants, or 22\%, then Stretching 6 participants, or 15\%. Reading and writing were the least, only selected by 4 and 2 participants respectively. Stretching 6 participants, or 15\% was the most completed habit based on selection, 60 times, ranking 10.0. Meditation ranked 6.25 and the least were the plank and reading with 3.75  and 1.75 respectively.

Participants with visual rewards, 14 participants, or 39\% had the highest total number of snoozes (72 total presses to 'Not Yet'), auditory had the smallest (14 total). The control group had 55 snoozes and visual-auditory had 45 snoozes. Most participants snoozed (answered 'Not Yet') in the morning (100 times), specifically mid (66) and late (27) morning. Visual-auditory had the most number of failed snoozes 10, split over 6 participants, 1 person had 5 failed snoozes, then it was auditory with 4.

Habit performance was also tracked in the form of a streak. If a participant did not track a habit for a day, their streak would be reset to 0. Meditation had the most cumulative streak (17) followed by stretching (7). High streaks (streak \verb|>| 10) had habits: meditation (135 streaks) and stretch (126 streaks). Visual-auditory rewards had the most streaks (126), control group (75) and visual (60). Stretch had the highest peak streak (18), meditation (15). However, overall, for all completed habits, meditation was the most streaked (269), stretching (231), press ups (39) and plank (24).

Mostly participants chose existing routines that were suggested to them. For example, during the pilot trials when asking for an existing routine, users were confused, so examples of habit contexts were provided (Figure~\ref{fig:habit_context_example}). The results found, 31, or 86\% participants chose one of the contexts that were listed as examples, some with a slight change in before and after wording, e.g. \textit{before} getting home from work, rather than \textit{after} getting home from work. The remaining 5 participants chose the following context: \textit{'Having a snack'}, \textit{'Sitting in bed'}, \textit{'Early morning'}, \textit{'During breakfast'} and \textit{'Before sleeping'}.

\subsubsection*{H1M1: The effect of positive reinforcement rewards on habit performance}

A one-way between-groups analysis of variance with planned comparisons was conducted to explore the effect of rewards on the number of habits completed, compared with the control group (Figure~\ref{fig:m1_h1}). Participants were divided into two groups: group 1 with rewards, group 2 without rewards. There was a statistically significant difference at the $p$ $<$ $0.005$ level in both groups for $2$$/$$3$ of the weeks: week 1, $F(1,23.20) = 9.48$, $p = 0.005$, week 2, $F(1,33.35) = 4.46$, p = 0.42 and week 3, $F(1,50) = 17.01$, $p\leq 0.005$. The effect size for week 1, week 2 and week 3 are large, calculated using $\eta^{2}$, were 0.25, 0.39 and 0.43 respectively, this shows a large difference in the mean scores.

\subsubsection*{H2M1: The effect of multiple modalities versus singular on habit performance}
A one-way between-groups analysis of variance with planned comparisons was conducted to explore the effect of multiple modalities and singular modalities on the number of habits completed (Figure~\ref{fig:m1_h2}). Participants were divided into two groups according to their mode: group 1: visual rewards, auditory rewards, group 2: visual-auditory rewards. There was a statistically significant difference at the $p$ $<$ $0.005$ level in week 2 and week 3, and lots in all groups: week 1, $F(1,50) = 0.69$, $p = 0.410$, week 2, $F(1,50) = 23.04$, $p$ $<$ $0.005$ and week 3, $F(1,50) = 8.85$, $p\leq 0.005$.

\subsubsection*{Habit Automaticity}
11 participants completed both SRBAI questionnaires, 2 control group, 2 auditory, 5 visual and 2 visual-auditory. A paired-samples t-test was conducted to evaluate the change of habit automaticity between the first SRBAI questionnaire (after week 3) and the second (after week 4). There was a statistically significant increase in automaticity scores from SRBAI 1 (mean = 14.18, SD = 3.78) to SRBAI 2 (mean = 15.09, SD = 4.34), $t(10) = 2.469$, $p$ $<$ $0.005$ (two-tailed). The mean increase in SRBAI scores was 0.90 with a 95\% confidence interval ranging from 0.08 to 1.72. The $\eta^{2} = 0.37$ indicates a large effect size.

\subsubsection*{H1M2: The effect of positive reinforcement rewards on habit automaticity}
An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare the habit automaticity scores
for rewards and control at both SRBAI 1 and SRBAI 2 (Figure~\ref{fig:m2_h1}). For SRBAI 1, there was also no significant differences in scores for rewards (mean = 14.33, SD = 3.84) and control (mean = 13.50, SD = 4.94; $t(9) = 0.224$, $p = 0.85$,
two-tailed). The magnitude of the differences in the means (mean difference = 0.83,
95\% CI: \-29.43 to 27.76) was very small ($\eta^{2} = 0.005$). For SRBAI 2, there was no significant difference in scores for rewards
(mean = 15.22, SD = 4.29) and control (mean = 14.50, SD = 6.36; $t(9) = 0.202$, $p = 0.84$,
two-tailed). The magnitude of the differences in the means (mean difference = 0.72,
95\% CI: \-8.80 to 7.36) was very small ($\eta^{2} = 0.004$).

A one-way between-groups analysis of variance with planned comparisons was also conducted to explore the impact of rewards on habit automaticity, as measured by the SRBAI 1 and 2. Participants were divided into two groups: group 1 with rewards, group 2 without rewards. There was not a
statistically significant difference for the two groups at SRBAI 1: $F(1,9) = 0.02$, $p = 0.88$, and SRBAI 2: $F(1,9) = 0.07$, $p = 0.78$. In addition, the difference in mean scores between the groups had, at SRBAI 1: a medium effect with an effect size $\eta^{2} = 0.11$, and at SRBAI 2: a large effect, with an effect size of $\eta^{2} = 0.17$.

\subsubsection*{H2M2: The effect of multiple modalities versus singular on habit automaticity}
A one-way between-groups analysis of variance with planned comparisons was conducted to explore the
impact of multiple modalities on habit automaticity, compared with singular modes as measured by the SRBAI 1 and 2 (Figure~\ref{fig:m2_h2}). Participants were divided into two groups according to their reward mode: group 1: visual rewards, auditory rewards and group 2: visual-auditory combined rewards. There was not a
statistically significant difference for the two groups at SRBAI 1:$ F(1,9) = 1.04$, $p = 0.33$, and SRBAI 2: $F(1,9) = 0.64$, $p = 0.44$. In addition, the difference in mean scores between the groups had, at SRBAI 1: a medium effect with an effect size of $\eta^{2} = 0.11$, and at SRBAI 2: a large effect, with an effect size of $\eta^{2} = 0.17$.

\subsubsection*{Why did you pick that habit?}
\begin{quote}
Participant 1: \textit{I was already doing meditation, but not the parts of meditation that were beneficial afterwards, I wasn't making it a habit. I wanted to not be stressed out of nut.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 2: \textit{Want to be more flexible, easier habit, I am not going to do the plank every morning, it is easier with not too much effort, less time consuming.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 3: \textit{I wanted to write in the morning, but half way through I changed to the later because I wasn't doing it.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 4: \textit{It's something I wanted to do for a long time, so I thought this would help me make it more regular, I downloaded headspace meditation app, but it was hard to remember to actually do it. Using the bot in combination with headspace was good. Because headspace doesn't send me iphone reminders, chatbot is better with reminders because it is in messenger. So I was doing the habit with headspace while using chatbot.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 5: \textit{It is something I wanted to do for a while, stress relief habit. Chance to give it a go for hope of it staying in the longer term.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 6: \textit{Picked it because it is something that successful people do and I get stressed really easy.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 7: \textit{I wanted to be more active and haven't had any exercise at all.}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{Are you still doing that habit?}
\begin{quote}
Participant 1: \textit{Meditation has been harder, but the first few days I was like, I now know how to do this. But if I got distracted it was harder to remember.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 2: \textit{No not stretching.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 3: \textit{No, just keep forgetting to do it or can't be bothered.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 4: \textit{Yes, but, its not as regular, I do miss it.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 5: \textit{I did it every now and again, usually I think about it, it depends, if I had a long day, sometimes I want to go to bed. Done it a couple of times, done it more when I was using the chatbot.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 6: \textit{I do it when I remember, I tend to do it now before bed, rather than after lunch, only if I remember.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 7: \textit{No, been out of town recently.}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{Did you like the chatbot?}
\begin{quote}
Participant 1: \textit{Neutral on it. Good that it let me know, but I am not sure about it.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 2: \textit{Pretty good.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 3: \textit{Yes I liked it. It has been great for reminding me to write.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 4: \textit{Would've liked to of interacted with it a bit more, and to of been able to ask it for help and support throughout. Maybe it would tell you tips, like how to set aside some time to do things and ideas on how to meditate, where to go, different apps to use, or things like that. Liked to of had a bit more interaction with the bot.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 5: \textit{Depending on my mood. If I was feeling okay it would remind me. Otherwise would get annoying, I ignored the message. If he said 'Not Yet', it would remind me sometimes when I already got to bed, (10.30pm), so needed a more precise time, maybe time boundaries.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 6: \textit{Liked it because it reminded me 2 hours later! This other app that I used, didn't.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 7: \textit{Yes, but was just always the same, repetitive. I was expecting different messages, like `Hey man' or `Hey [name]'. It needed to be a bit more caring about the person and a bit less like a robot.}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{How were the rewards?}
\begin{quote}
Participant 1: \textit{I didn't like the rewards, getting the GIF I was like, oh. I skipped over the GIF. I just wanted to get rid of the red dot on messenger. Because it was a bot, I just wanted to get rid of it. After the fourth time I saw same GIF it was bad. If it recognised my progress it would've been better. Based on my trend, my progress and if I done it on time. They didn't encourage me to move forward with my habit or set me back.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 2: \textit{A bit weird, a bit funny, weird just a black screen. I liked the buttons that you could pick. But I didn't need a reward, it was unnecessary, the message was enough. Maybe use stats as they are cool, because you can reflect on data. Better to have info, like `you are almost there'.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 3: \textit{Some of them were funny but maybe it works with other people and not me. I wanted different types of rewards and I didn't really like them. Maybe have, a measurement of something, if a person starts doing good, writing then give them their measurement, giving them constant well done's and stats. When they feel like they are making progress, they are more encouraged to keep doing it, rather than random music.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 5: \textit{Cute, but I didn't think it gave me an intensive towards meditation, nice little extra. Not the sort of thing you want just before you go to bed, as I try to avoid the computer and phone before bed, not good for your sleep. But liked them.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 7: \textit{I was always waiting to open them, the combination was perfect, it was funny. They were repetitive but not annoying.}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{Do you want it back?}
\begin{quote}
Participant 1: \textit{I am interested in having it back and it was good while it was there.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 2: \textit{Yes, if it was enclosed in a Fitbit, because it would be all in one place.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 3: \textit{Yes, but maybe, but only thing that I didn't like, was my reward.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 4: \textit{Yes, if it had a bit more interaction with it, I would. In its current form, I wouldn't. It made me think I should download the headspace app on my phone. But the chatbot reminders were useful.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 5: \textit{Would be more willing to give it a go if it had a more precise time, then yes.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 6: \textit{Yes, definition. But I also downloaded an app that sends you a reminder, because they sent you a mindful message. But Harry's Habits had the snoozing `Not Yet' thing, that was better.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 7: \textit{Yes. The bot was a helpful tool to remind me to do things.}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{Additional Comments}
\begin{quote}
Participant 1: \textit{Would be fine without rewards.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 3: \textit{I participated in it to change my habits. Problem was with being consistent with a habit. I was very busy for a week and so didn't really write.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 4: \textit{I felt like I needed the rewards. I wanted to put my own habit in and wanted drawing.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 6: \textit{First few days were great, stuck to it. Bot was easy to setup. After a few days, I read the message and I would just do it later. Moved to new house and ran out of data, so got no data. Worked well at beginning, got worse and worse, still doing it, but it was at midnight.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Participant 7: \textit{I used the stretching as reminder for that and then to be more active, and go swimming. Sometimes I remember it, but don't always do it still. I want a chatbot to continue to help with my depression, my therapist said: every hour each day set alarm, saying how are you feeling right now, what are you feeling, is it based on reality or based on expectations? The chatbot for me, is very helpful to break my cycle, in my case, sometimes I get a thought and it cycles in my head, these things break this. After a while I stopped setting reminders, but only after 6 months, these repetitive things helped make a habit and helped me stick to a routine. But for this project, I wanted some different messages because otherwise, it is just an alarm that I had before. I want something more to replicate some sort of person.}
\end{quote}

In addition to the above interview transcripts 1 participant left feedback directly with the bot, and two people left public reviews about the bot.

\begin{quote}
Participant with visual-auditory rewards and the meditation habit: \textit{Also I felt the questions [SRBAI] afterwards about meditation being something I do without thinking were just repeating the same question with a different phrasing. So I don't know how useful they are. The chatbot made me aware I wasn't keeping up with something and I feel it could have been a little more adaptive to try and remind me in different ways or at different times. I would say I felt more like it was a reminder that I wasn't doing well at forming the habit.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Review 1: (Rated 2 out of 5) \textit{'I felt a bit like I was being nagged, and I don't like being nagged. The rewards were a bit odd. Would be nice to actually set a time to be asked about the habit.'}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
Review 2: (Rated 4 out of 5) \textit{'Interesting project but I did not ultimately feel motivated, the reminders became more of a chore than something I wanted to do.'}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Discussion}
This research aimed to understand more about positive reinforcement rewards from different modalities and their role in habit formation. The results report that participants receiving bot-delivered rewards completed more habits than the control group without rewards. Participants with visual-auditory rewards had the highest habit automaticity score and during participant interviews (N = 7) and all participants reported a drop in habit performance after 1-week without the prototype.

\subsection{Interview Analysis}
The interview transcripts were analysed and participants were anonymised following a thematic approach~\cite{thematic_analysis_qualatitive_data}. Below, we consider the role of each participants during the process of interacting with the chatbot and reflect how their interaction may of had a meaningful impact to their formation of a new habit.

\subsubsection*{Habit Repetition}
Participants discussed how they picked their habit, they chose because they had wanted to start for the particular habit for a long time, it was \textit{'not too much effort'} and \textit{'something successful people do'}. They wanted \textit{'to be more active'}, \textit{'relieve stress'} and wanted a habit that was \textit{'less time consuming'}. Throughout, participants mostly completed their habits, but, one participant always put the message off and eventually their performance got \textit{'worse and worse'} until they stopped all together. This is confirmed after the bot was removed, with all interviewed participants (N = 7) finding it difficult to continue with their habit. They \textit{'kept forgetting'}, found it \textit{'harder to remember'} and lacked motivation, not performing the action if it had \textit{'been a long day'}. Some tried to do it \textit{'every now and again'}, but usually they would only complete it if \textit{'they remembered'}. This reveals the dependency between technology and habits, suggesting that the bot did not increase habit automaticity, or that the existing routine participants chose was not suitable for new habits, or that they were not given enough time to develop automaticity.

\subsubsection*{Attitudes Towards Rewards}
Participants had mixed feelings about the rewards. Some \textit{'did not like the [visual] rewards'}, skipping over them after the first few, they \textit{'just wanted to get rid of the notification dot'}. Another participant said \textit{'some of them [visual-auditory rewards] were funny'}, but they did not like them overall and mentioned the auditory rewards were \textit{'too random'}. One participant thought they did not give them an incentive towards their habit, just a \textit{'nice little extra'}. They also discussed including time-sensitive rewards, as they did not want to listen to music before going to bed. This shows the importance of using an appropriate modality at particular times, e.g. not having auditory rewards at certain times of the day. Finally, an upbeat participant talked about \textit{'always wanting to open them'} and \textit{'the combination was perfect'}. However, they said they also found them \textit{'repetitive'}.

\subsubsection*{Attitudes Towards the Chatbot}
Participants were asked about how they found the chatbot as the method of interaction. They found the method \textit{'pretty good'}, they \textit{'liked it'} and \textit{'would have liked more interaction'}. Suggesting additional features, such as \textit{'help and support throughout'}, \textit{'ideas on how to improve your habit'} and \textit{'advice on how to set aside time for your habit'}. Others were neutral, some expecting \textit{'different messages, such as Hey [name], a bit more care about the person, a bit less like a robot'}. Lots of participants (N = 4) enjoyed the reminder aspect, but a few found it \textit{'repetitive'} and \textit{'got annoying if I pressed Not Yet'}. Participants wanted to see their progress as they tracked their habits, they talked about wanting to reflect on their data. They mentioned that they would feel \textit{'more encouraged to keep doing it, rather than random music [auditory rewards]'}. Mostly participants wanted the prototype to come back with a few modifications: \textit{'enclosed with Fitbit so it is all in a single place'}, \textit{'fine without rewards'} (2 participants mentioned this), \textit{'more interaction'} and \textit{'with statistics about my progress'}. Participants wanted the bot as more of a \textit{'constant persistent reminder'} with additional tracking elements to remind them to perform their habit to fit into their busy schedule. Participants (N = 5) mentioned the \textit{headspace} app (\url{www.headspace.com}), mentioning that they wanted a combination of the bot and headspace. It prompted another participant to download the headspace app. They wanted the bot to keep on track of their habit and they would use the headspace app to help them perform their mindfulness.


\subsubsection{Habit Performance}
The results found that participants are more likely to complete their habit if given one of the rewards and participants completed more habits with visual or auditory rewards than visual-auditory rewards.

\subsubsection*{M1H1: The Rewards effect on Habit Performance}
There was a statistically significant drop in habit performance for the control group without rewards. This reveals the effect the rewards had on participant interaction with the bot and habit performance. Although this is contradicted from the interviews where participants discussed negative feelings towards rewards later in the 3-week period. The findings show that rewards did improve habit performance.

\subsubsection*{M1H2: Multiple Modalities effect on Habit Performance}
There is a significant difference between the visual-auditory modes on the number of completed habits. But the result appears to be different to the initial hypotheses, with more participants completing habits with singular mode rewards than multiple. This contradicts the belief that multiple modalities benefits task completion, however these results only impact the particular rewards delivered by this bot. Therefore, it is inconclusive whether multiple modalities rewards in the general sense impact habit performance.


\subsubsection{Habit Automaticity}
It is inconclusive whether the rewards or the combined modalities affected habit automaticity.

\subsubsection*{M2H1: The Rewards effect on Habit Automaticity}
Each individual reward did not have a significant effect on habit automaticity. Although participants with rewards had slightly higher automaticity scores, follow up interviews suggest that automaticity did not develop.

\subsubsection*{M2H2: Multiple Modalities effect on Habit Automaticity}
Participants with visual-auditory combined reward had higher habit automaticity scores compared with visual or auditory rewards. However, these were not statistically significant.

% Under half the participants completed the modality survey (N = 12, 40\%). These had the following rewards: visual rewards had the highest score (the higher, the more participants preferred the reward) (mean = 12, SD = 3.347), visual and auditory rewards were slightly below (mean = 10.75, SD = 1.893).
% TODO: Compare these results to people not using the chatbot, e.g.. people signing up to the gym, new years resolution

\subsubsection{Chatbot Success}
The chatbot was partially successful at running a research trial. There were several issues and various limitations with development. However, it was generally liked by participants and it was easy to gather a lot of useful data.

Participants had mixed feelings towards the bot. Their performance shows that the number of snoozes over time decreased, but the number of total habits completed per day also decreased for all reward types (including the control group). However, participant streaks over time increased and 36 participants manage to use it for 3-weeks.

Participants had various issues with bot interaction. Seven participants tried to message the bot during setup, instead of using the built in \textit{quick reply} buttons. This broke the setup flow and they had to start again. Other participants tried to send multiple messages when asked for free input, they went around an endless loop when asking for a habit type and participants tried to mark their habit as completed using the Facebook Messenger thumb emotion (which the bot was not coded for). A participant also pointed out that they could change their existing routine time but were unable to change the description.

Participants gave additional feedback by simply messaging the bot. They asked inquisitive questions, such as \textit{'what kind of thing are you looking to find out'}, \textit{'this is not working for me'} and \textit{'stop'} --- to try and stop the daily messages (the participant then blocked the bot). Negative feedback towards the rewards and bot were also expressed. When asked about being messaged every day, a participant sent this reply and then blocked the bot: \textit{'Do not do that, it will be annoying'}, and another said \textit{'never message me'}. Another stated that this was the \textit{'lame same band'} after receiving an auditory reward.

Participants were able to personalise the chatbot with several different variable configurations. This personalisation could have effected the findings by not narrowing the condition variables. Replicating this research with tighter a configuration is needed to validate this line of reasoning. Finally

Streaks could have been better used to give insight to participants progress and challenged them to maintain it, using loss aversion~\cite{loss_aversion} to compare the impact of their broken streak with the gain of keeping it. However, all participants interviewed (N = 7) struggled with maintaining habit performance after the bot was removed. This suggests a dependence between the technology and the habit as participants depended on bot notifications to continue repeating the desired action.


\subsection*{Summary}
The chatbot rewards from different modalities effected habit formation (RQ1) with the singular modes improving habit performance, but not habit automaticity. Feedback towards interaction with the chatbot was mostly positive (RQ2), but all interviewed participants suggested features they would like, likely because it did not fulfil their needs. The rewards delivered by the chatbot got a mixed reception from participants and did not increase habit automaticity, but they did improve habit performance. Therefore, the chatbot is partially effective for supporting habit formation (RQ3).
