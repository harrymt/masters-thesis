\section*{Executive Summary}
Habit formation technologies use rewards and points as means for
providing positive reinforcement, often in the format of visual
or audio rewards such as jingles, badges or animations.
Providing the right reward increases the chances for developing a new habit; yet, research on how these rewards should be delivered and the impact that this has on the process of habit formation is scarce.
In this thesis we investigate how three types of positive reinforcement (visual, auditory, visual-auditory) influence habit performance and automaticity.
Sixty people participated in a 4-week study where a custom built chatbot was used to deliver different types of positive reinforcement rewards for completing a new daily habit.
The results reported higher habit performance rates when a reward was present without necessarily increasing behaviour automaticity.
This has implications for the design of habit formation technologies that rely on visual and auditory rewards as means of positive reinforcement.

This research presents four main contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A review of existing habit formation techniques, impact of rewards from different modalities and behaviour change interventions used in technology.
  \item Design guidelines for building chatbots that deliver rewards based on different modalities.
  \item Technical specification and implementation details of \textit{Harry's Habits} --- a chatbot to track habits and deliver rewards from three modalities: visual, auditory and visual-auditory.
  \item A description and results of a 4-week user study where sixty people participated to test the impact of each reward on habit automaticity and habit performance.
\end{enumerate}
