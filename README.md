## How Rewards from different modalities effect Habit-Formation

My [thesis](thesis/main.pdf) measures how rewards from different modalities effects peoples habit strength, using a chatbot to track habits by sending notifications to reminder users and delivering rewards from three modalities.

An evaluation trial tests this chatbot using real-world participants that will use the bot to track any simple habit over 30 days.
